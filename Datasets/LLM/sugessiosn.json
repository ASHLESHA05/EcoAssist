    "introduction": "These days, you might be thinking about how to reduce your carbon footprint. It is impossible to miss news about the environmental effects of burning fossil fuels. While the problem is big, little changes you make every day can help contribute to a cleaner, greener future.\n\nBefore we talk about ways to reduce your carbon footprint, we must first ask, “what is a carbon footprint?” A carbon footprint is the sum of all the byproducts that come from using fossil fuels to manufacture and move goods, build structures for homes and businesses, provide food, and travel.\n\nThe gasses produced by these activities, namely carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and , are called greenhouse gasses because they trap heat in the atmosphere, raising the average temperature of earth.\n\nReducing your carbon footprint means changing how you approach and participate in activities that produce greenhouse gasses. This guide will show you how.",

            "description": "Driving a car is a major source of greenhouse gasses. Cutting down on the miles you drive is one of the best things you can do for reducing carbon emissions. Organize shopping trips to get more done on each outing, walk or bike when distances are shorter, and use public transportation as much as possible."

            "title": "Go easy on the acceleration and brakes",
            "description": "How much you drive is not the only factor to consider. Acceleration burns more fuel, so applying the brakes and speeding up is less fuel efficient than maintaining a smooth, even speed."

            "description": "When your car runs efficiently, it uses less energy. Clean oil and belts and timing gears that are perfectly adjusted will help you get the most out of every gallon of fuel. Also, when properly inflated, tires require less energy to achieve and maintain speed while driving. If the pressure is too low, your car is sluggish and burns more gasoline than necessary."

            "description": "It is easy to tell people to drive less, but that might not be possible in your situation. Driving an electric vehicle and doing your electric car charging at home can help eliminate the greenhouse gasses that your conventional car produces. Not all homes are wired for an electric car charging station. Rewiring may be expensive. Another option is to find an electric car charging station and power up there."

            "description": "Traveling by air spews more greenhouse gas than traveling by car. To help put this in perspective, a single round-trip flight across the U.S. produces roughly 2 tons of carbon dioxide per person, which equals about 10 percent of a U.S. citizen’s annual carbon footprint. If you can fly less often, it’s an effective way to reduce your carbon footprint."

When you consider using power to produce and ship their food, then ship them to processing and eventually to market, you are talking about a sizable carbon footprint. One of the delicious and healthy ways to reduce your carbon footprint is to switch to high-protein vegetables and certain grains for some of your meals."

A garbage truck needs to pick it up from your home, haul it to a landfill or processing center, then it undergoes even more energy-using processing. By composting some of your organic waste, you cut down on the volume of refuse headed for the dump and also create useful organic matter for fertilizing your garden."

Many items are made of plastic derived from oil. The carbon footprint includes the material itself and the energy used in manufacturing and transporting it to you. Once used, it becomes waste that consumes even more energy. Switching to reusable containers has a much lower impact on the environment."
